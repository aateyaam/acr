    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      For all our national institutes of eminence, it is a well-known fact that
      the Alumni have always played a key role in building the institute and its
      reputation. Likewise, we at IIT Hyderabad have identified the Alumni
      Relations office as one of the key pillars of our institute and the office
      of Dean Alumni Relations has recently been established.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since assuming the office, we have initiated several outreach activities
      to welcome you back to your alma mater and to professionalize the
      engagement with our Alumni. In the upcoming period, we intend to carry out
      more outreach activities such as reunions, campaigns, alumni day, and
      alumni talks. Even without any special event or invitation, as you have
      been a part of the IIT Hyderabad family, we would just love to have you
      visit us on the campus, have a brief 'chit-chat', witness our campus
      development, and have a simple 'chai pe charcha'. The growth of our campus
      on all fronts not just relies on the people currently here but we would
      also love to hear and learn from your experiences to make IIT Hyderabad
      the best in our nation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your support in any form would help us build the institute and achieve the
      status of being 'the best' from 'one of the best'. We are always available
      to hear from you and to welcome you back to IIT Hyderabad.
